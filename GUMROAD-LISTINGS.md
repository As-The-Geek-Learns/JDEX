**Finally, a system that makes sense.**

Tired of drowning in folders? Can't find that important document? JDex brings the brilliance of the Johnny Decimal organizational system to your Mac with a beautiful, intuitive interface.

## What is Johnny Decimal?

Johnny Decimal is a system for organizing your digital (and physical) life. Instead of endless nested folders, everything gets a number:

- **10-19** Personal
- **20-29** Work  
- **30-39** Projects

Within each area, categories (10, 11, 12...) contain folders (10.01, 10.02...) which hold your items (10.01.01, 10.01.02...).

**The result?** You always know where everything is. No more searching. No more duplicates.
